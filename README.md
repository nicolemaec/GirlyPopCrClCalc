# crcl calculator
i made this because the MdCalc calculator would display different values based on weight, but wouldn't say where the values came from, causing me to do everything manually anyway. as a girly pop pharmacist who has to calculate renal function a lot, i made this website to save myself time. <br><br>
all results have been verified with md calc itself, formulas have been copied/pasted straight from the man himself.<br><br>
"PharmDCalc", if you will...
